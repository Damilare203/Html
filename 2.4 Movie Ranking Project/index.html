<p>loved it because of the relatable storyline and great image</p>

<li><h3>Matrix Trilogy</h3></li>
<p>One of the best Sci-fi Movies ever produced,still very much the standard even after over 20 years since the first part was released.</p>

<li><h3>Sister's Act</h3></li>
<p>My all time black comedy movie. loved it due to the nostalgic effect on me which has me watching it at least once every two years.Also one of favourite actress was in that movie.</p>

<li><h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3></li>
<p>No film in the Drama genre has ever been outdone by the great master piece. The storyline, the dialogues and the characters made the movie to be my favourite in the drame genre.</p>

<li><h3>Casino</h3></li>
<p>The world lacks crime movies that go from not just being a classic,but all being a generational movie .</p>

<li><h3>The X-Files</h3></li>
<p>Moulder Fox and Scully Dana with the other significant character made this serie my favourite.</p>
